Hi, 
If you use shorts commands you may install this thing in your main.js folder

- First create a folder an named it "commands"
- Second put any command  like "clear.js" (you can find this command in my repositories) inside the folder commands
- Third start the bot and look at your console, you may see that clear.js has been loaded.

Enjoy !
